## About me

I am interested on how plants deal with **temperature**, especially under the current and future **global warming**. I focus in understanding the effects of climate change on plants, from the leaf level to communities. Combining **physiological** and **demographic** **techniques** I want to identify potential species' capacity to tolerate climate stresses and how communities will eventually fluctuate on time and space.
